# Nginx server configuration for Kirby CMS

As I had to do quite a bit of searching when setting up my local development environment for Kirby, I thought it might be helpful for others as well. 
This has been tested for [Kirby CMS](https://getkirby.com/) 3.5.

**Note: This config is not suitable for a production environment as it lacks any security settings**
